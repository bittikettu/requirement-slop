== IO requirements

[[IO-REQ-001]]
=== IO-REQ-001: The module shall have 8 digital inputs

[horizontal]
Description::
- The module shall be equipped with 8 digital inputs designed for robust signal acquisition. 
- Each input supports sufficient attenuation (e.g., up to 20 dB) to ensure proper signal conditioning and compatibility across various
applications.
- These inputs are compatible with standard digital signal standards, ensuring seamless data transmission and accurate signal representation within the system's operational range. 
- The design incorporates features that mitigate common issues such as noise interference and signal distortion, ensuring reliable performance under diverse environmental conditions.

Rationale::
The requirement for **8 digital inputs** is justified by the need to:
1. Support a wide range of sensors, controls, and user interactions.
2. Ensure compatibility with existing systems and future expansions.
3. Enhance reliability through redundancy and robust error handling.
4. Provide a cost-effective, user-friendly solution that aligns with functional and safety requirements.

== kas buildsystem requirements

[[KAS-REQ-001]]
=== KAS-REQ-001: The System shall have kas as a build system

[[KAS-REQ-002]]
=== KAS-REQ-002: If INPUT1 is pressed, then the OUTPUT1 shall activate

[horizontal]
Description::
This requirement defines the system behavior where pressing INPUT1 causes OUTPUT1 to activate.
Rationale::
This behavior ensures that the system provides a direct and deterministic response to user input, allowing INPUT1 to control OUTPUT1 as part of the intended user interaction or control function.

Do not do it.
